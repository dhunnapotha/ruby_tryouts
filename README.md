- Repository where I can try out few basics / gotchas of Ruby. 
- All the tryouts have the corresponding tests in the same file. 
- Tried to keep the test case names as descriptive as possible.

Tryouts in particular are:
- class_and_instance_eval.rb --> Talks about class_eval and instance_eval functions
- eigen_classes.rb -> Talks about eigenclass (singleton/ metaclass) methods for both instances and classes
